# QUICK SETUP GUIDE
## The Crucible PDF Audio Reader

## 🎯 What This Does

- Shows the **actual PDF** on screen (the same one students have)
- **Jumps to the right page** automatically when you click a scene
- **Audio syncs** with the text - no confusion about which version to read

---

## 📁 STEP 1: Set Up Your Files

Create a folder (anywhere on your computer) and put these files in it:

```
YourFolder/
├── crucible_pdf_reader.html  (the file you just downloaded)
├── Crucible_1.mp3            (your audio file)
└── 07_Crucible_Act_I_Complete.pdf  (the PDF)
```

**IMPORTANT**: The files MUST be named exactly as shown above, or the program won't find them.

---

## 🚀 STEP 2: Open It

Double-click `crucible_pdf_reader.html`

It should open in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari - any will work).

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Test It

You should see:
- **Left sidebar** with scene buttons
- **Audio player** at the top
- **PDF** displayed in the main area

### Try These Tests:

1. **Click the play button** on the audio player (▶️ button)
   - You should hear the audio start

2. **Click a scene** in the left sidebar
   - The PDF should jump to that page
   - The audio should jump to that time

3. **Try keyboard shortcuts**:
   - Spacebar = Play/Pause
   - Left Arrow = Rewind 5 seconds
   - Right Arrow = Fast forward 5 seconds

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### ⚠️ "Audio file not found"

**Problem**: You see a red warning about the audio file

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure `Crucible_1.mp3` is in the **same folder** as the HTML file
2. Make sure it's spelled exactly: `Crucible_1.mp3` (capital C, underscore, no spaces)
3. Try renaming your audio file to match exactly

### ⚠️ PDF doesn't show

**Problem**: The PDF area is blank or shows an error

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure the PDF is in the same folder
2. Make sure it's named exactly: `07_Crucible_Act_I_Complete.pdf`
3. Try opening the HTML file in a different browser
4. Some browsers block PDFs - try Chrome or Firefox

### ⚠️ Play button doesn't work

**Problem**: Clicking play does nothing

**Solutions**:
1. Try clicking directly on the audio player's play button (not the button below it)
2. Check your browser's address bar for a "blocked audio" icon - click it to allow
3. Right-click the audio player and select "Play"
4. Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)

### ⚠️ Scenes don't jump to the right page

**Problem**: PDF stays on the same page when you click scenes

**Solutions**:
1. This is normal for some browsers - they restrict iframe navigation
2. You can manually scroll the PDF to the right page
3. The page number is shown in the bottom-right corner
4. Try using Chrome or Firefox which handle this better

## 📝 ADJUSTING TIMESTAMPS

The timestamps are estimated. To make them perfect for your audio:

1. **Listen to your audio file** and note when each scene begins
2. **Open the HTML file** in a text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, VS Code)
3. **Find this section** (around line 250):

```javascript
const scenes = [
    { id: 1, name: "Opening / Overture", time: 0, page: 4 },
    { id: 2, name: "Parris and Betty", time: 120, page: 4 },
    // etc...
];
```

4. **Change the `time:` values** to match your audio (time is in seconds)
5. **Change the `page:` values** if needed to match your PDF
6. **Save the file** and refresh your browser

---

## 🎨 PAGE NUMBER REFERENCE

These are the approximate pages in the PDF for each scene:

### For Students:
- **Use headphones** for better audio quality
- **Follow along** with a physical copy of the text
- **Pause frequently** to take notes
- **Use the speed controls** (0.75x is great for EL learners)

### For EL Students:

- **Replay sections** using the rewind button
- **Read along** while listening for better comprehension
- **Use physical copy** to annotate and take notes

## 🆘 STILL HAVING PROBLEMS?

### Check These:

- [ ] All three files are in the SAME folder
- [ ] File names match EXACTLY (including capitals and numbers)
- [ ] You're opening the HTML file (not the PDF or audio)
- [ ] Your browser allows audio playback
- [ ] You tried refreshing the page (F5)
- [ ] You tried a different web browser

### Advanced Fix: Manual Audio Path

If the audio still won't play, try this:

1. Open the HTML file in a text editor
2. Find this line (around line 162):
```html
<source src="../uploads/Crucible_1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
<source src="Crucible_1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
```
3. Change BOTH lines to just:
```html
<source src="Crucible_1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
```
4. Save and try again
