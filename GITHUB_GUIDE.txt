   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Crucible Audio Reader"

4. CREATE REPO ON GITHUB (via website)
   - Go to github.com
   - Create new repository (as in Option 1)
   - DON'T check "Add a README" this time

5. CONNECT AND PUSH
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/crucible-audio-reader.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main

6. ENABLE GITHUB PAGES (same as Option 1, step 4)


OPTION 3: DESKTOP APP
=========================================

   https://desktop.github.com/

   - Click "Publish Repository"

4. ENABLE GITHUB PAGES (same as Option 1, step 4)


IMPORTANT NOTES
=========================================

⚠️  FILE SIZE WARNING:
GitHub has a 100MB file size limit. Your audio file 
(Crucible_1.mp3 - 26MB) is fine, but if you add more 
acts, you might hit the limit.

If you get file size errors:
- Option A: Use Git LFS (Large File Storage)
- Option B: Host audio elsewhere (Google Drive, Dropbox)
  and link to it in the HTML

📝 .gitignore FILE:
You might want to create a .gitignore file to exclude
certain files. Create a file named ".gitignore" with:

# Large files (if needed)
*.mp3
*.pdf

(But for this project, you WANT to include these!)


UPDATING YOUR PROJECT
=========================================

When you make changes:

OPTION 1 (Website):
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the file to update
3. Click the pencil icon (Edit)
4. Make changes
5. Click "Commit changes"

OPTION 2 (Desktop App):
1. Make changes to files locally
2. Open GitHub Desktop
3. It will show your changes
4. Add commit message
5. Click "Commit to main"
6. Click "Push origin"

OPTION 3 (Command Line):
git add .
git commit -m "Updated timestamps"
git push


SHARING WITH STUDENTS
=========================================

Once on GitHub Pages, students can:

✅ Open directly in browser (no download)
✅ Bookmark the link
✅ Works on Chromebooks, iPads, phones
✅ Always get the latest version

Your link will be:
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/crucible-audio-reader/crucible_pdf_reader.html

Example:
https://ryanteacher.github.io/crucible-audio-reader/crucible_pdf_reader.html


PRIVACY & COPYRIGHT
=========================================

⚠️  IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:

1. PUBLIC vs PRIVATE:
   - Public = Anyone can see and download
   - Private = Only you (and people you invite)
   - For classroom use, Public is usually fine

2. COPYRIGHT:
   - The Crucible text is copyrighted
   - Fair Use likely applies for educational use
   - Consider if your school has permissions
   - You might want to make repo private
   - Or remove PDF and have students use physical books

3. AUDIO:
   - Make sure you have rights to the audio recording
   - If it's from an audiobook, check licensing


TROUBLESHOOTING
=========================================

"File too large" error:
→ Use Git LFS or host files elsewhere

Can't find my repository:
→ Go to github.com/YOUR-USERNAME

GitHub Pages not working:
→ Wait a few minutes, check Settings > Pages
→ Make sure file is named exactly: crucible_pdf_reader.html

Students can't access:
→ Make sure repository is Public
→ Check the URL is correct
→ Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled


HELPFUL GITHUB RESOURCES
